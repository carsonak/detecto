## Overview

In this project, you will build a real-time person detection and counting system. The application will use a FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend to process images or video streams, detect people in a frame, and display results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

You'll create a full workflow where users can upload or stream footage, detect people in real time, and analyze crowd size or presence over time. This project will introduce you to computer vision, model deployment, and modern web integration.

## Role Play

You are working on an automation and safety team. Your goal is to create a system that monitors spaces (like entrances, classrooms, or warehouses) and detects the number of people in each frame. The solution should be accurate, responsive, and easy to use for operators or analysts who need quick visual feedback.

## Learning Objectives

- Build a React-based dashboard for visual detection and analytics.
- Serve a person detection model (YOLO, OpenCV DNN, or similar) through FastAPI.
- Display bounding boxes and confidence levels over detected people.
- Log detections with timestamps for analysis and monitoring.
- Optimize detection speed and visualization for real-world use.

## Instructions

### AI & Processing

- Use a pretrained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv8, SSD, or MobileNet-SSD) trained on COCO or another dataset with person labels.
- Apply preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization, contrast adjustment) to prepare frames.
- The backend should:
  - Accept an image or frame (via upload or API).
  - Run inference and return:
    - The number of detected people.
    - The bounding boxes, confidence scores, and positions.
  - Optionally return the image with overlays (boxes and labels).
- Save each detection result with:
  - Timestamp
  - Number of people detected
  - Average confidence

### Frontend (React/Vite)

- Build two main pages:
  1. Detection View
  - Upload or stream video frames.
  - Display bounding boxes for detected people.
  - Show the total count and confidence for each detection.
  - Display processing time per frame.
  1. History View
  - Show a table or graph of detections over time (timestamp vs. number of people).
  - Include filters (date, time, confidence threshold).
- Display clear error messages for invalid or unsupported files.
- Ensure smooth rendering even with multiple detections.

### Backend (FastAPI)

- Implement endpoints for:
  - /detect → accepts an image file (JPEG, PNG) via multipart/form-data or base64, runs inference, returns:
    - JSON with count, coordinates, and confidence per person.
    - Processed image (base64 or file path).
  - /history → retrieves past detections from storage.
  - /reset → clears stored detection history.
- Store results locally (SQLite, JSON, or CSV).
- Handle errors (missing files, empty uploads, unsupported formats).
- Include simple performance logging (inference time, accuracy metrics).

### Dataset

- You can use open datasets such as:
  - COCO Dataset (contains "person" class)
  - CrowdHuman Dataset
- Include at least 10 demo images in frontend/public/samples/ for testing.

### Code Quality

- Keep code modular, commented, and logically separated.
- Backend and frontend should be independently testable.
- Use environment variables (.env files or system environment variables) for API keys or configuration. Both approaches are acceptable.
- The README.md must include:
  - Project purpose and architecture
  - Setup and run instructions for both frontend and backend
  - Testing methodology and evaluation metrics
  - Example results with screenshots

### Testing & Validation

Students should test the model on at least 10 sample images and document results in README.md.

Implementation Guidelines:

- Detection Accuracy: Manually count visible persons in each test image, compare with model detections. Formula: (Correct detections) ÷ (Total visible persons) × 100%
- False Positives: Count any bounding boxes that don't contain a person.
- Average Inference Time: Log processing time for each image; calculate mean. Test on the same hardware consistently.
- Average Confidence: Take the mean of confidence scores for all valid person detections across all test images.
- System Reliability: Run all 10+ test images; system should process all without crashes or errors.

Document all results in a table in your README with actual numbers from your tests:

| Metric                 | Description                                | Target  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Detection Accuracy     | Correct detections ÷ total visible persons | ≥ 85 %  |
| False Positives        | Non-person detections                      | ≤ 10 %  |
| Average Inference Time | Time per image (local GPU/CPU)             | ≤ 1.5 s |
| Average Confidence     | Mean confidence of valid detections        | ≥ 0.7   |
| System Reliability     | Handles all test images without crashing   | 100 %   |

Required Documentation:

- Include 2–3 screenshots of successful detections in the README.md.
- Log test cases and failures (e.g., occlusion or partial visibility).
- Mention what worked well and what could be improved.

## Bonus

- Add real-time webcam or CCTV feed with detection overlays.
- Include region-based alerts (e.g., "too many people in restricted area").
- Implement heatmaps or tracking lines for movement visualization.
- Add a small statistics panel (average crowd size per hour).
- Support live video capture through browser or local camera.
- Export detection history to CSV or Excel format.

## Tips for Success

- Start with single image detection before moving to video or streaming.
- Keep bounding boxes visible but not cluttered.
- Benchmark performance on different image resolutions.
- Use GPU acceleration (if available) for faster inference.
- Record inference time and average confidence for transparency.
